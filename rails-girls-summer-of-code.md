# Rails Girls Summer of Code

## Welcome to Rails Girls Summer of Code with Codeuino

**Rails Girls Summer of Code** is an [award-winning](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-06-01-ruby-heroes-2016) global fellowship program aimed at bringing more diversity into Open Source. It welcomes all women and non-binary applicants who want to gain a footing in the world of coding and further expand their knowledge and skills. The focus is on advanced-beginners who want to enter programming full-time.

As a fellowship program, successful applicants are paid a monthly stipend, from July to September. This breaks down all-too-common financial barriers, allowing students to work on a worthwhile Open Source project.

Working in two-person teams, students are supported by a mentor directly involved with the Open Source project, and independent coaches with extensive developer experience.

Potential mentors are invited to assign themselves on the projects they want to mentor this summer under Codeuino community. The person who is willing to mentor takes up the project within the community and propose it under RGSOC on the basis of involvement and prior knowledge of it.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.

**Consider proposing your own ideas as well that match the community project style**.

3. **Prepare a good overview of your project** idea\(s\)
4. **Review student proposals** and work with other mentors and organization admins to select the best candidates for Codeuino.
5. **Ensure your Student is Active.** They should have a good community involvement and good discussions. Should be answerable wherever they are tagged.
6.  **Reach out to the Summer of Code organization administrators** if you have questions or concerns.
7. **Do weekly meeting with students and give weekly report to Organization Admins.**
